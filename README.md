__How IaC Blueprints Resolved the Identified Problem Statements ?__

- Reduces the requirement of skilled Devops Engineer. We can then onboard an resource in our Devops team with Limited to basic knowledge of IaC and Devops. It has advantages on both sides â€“

| __#__ | __Pointers__ |
| --------- | --------- |
| 1. | From Devops Team Perspective, hiring and onboarding is fast. |
| 2. | From Resource Perspective, delivery is more or less like other team members (Subject to little or No Support) using IaC without being overwhelmed. |

- Less time in Knowledge Transfer and No Impact in delivery.

- Scalability of Team improves with time because based on Use cases, more IaC Blueprints gets added thereby allowing to use One Resource for Multiple Projects.
